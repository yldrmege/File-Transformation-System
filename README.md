# File Transformation System
 File conversion tool in C.
 
A command-line tool was developed to enable file conversion between CSV, Binary, and XML formats. Additionally, an XSD schema was prepared to validate XML files.

All coding was done in the C programming language. To ensure data integrity and compatibility across formats, appropriate data structures and algorithms were implemented. A user-friendly command-line interface was provided, allowing input and output files to be specified easily.

During development, special attention was given to file reading/writing operations, memory management, and error handling mechanisms. XML validation was integrated to ensure compliance with the XSD schema. As a result, a reliable and efficient solution was provided for seamless data transfer between different formats.
